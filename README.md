Unfinished project.
The idea is to have a platform for kids to learn how to code, similar to https://studio.code.org/home.

Unique selling idea would be to utilize LLMs to help the kids when they struggle with a level.
Currently dropped due to lack of interest in researched groups. Could come back in the future with more resources to build.
